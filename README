This is a very, very basic multiplayer functionality hacked on top of erike's asteroids bookmarklet at http://erkie.github.com/ .

Also included is a very, very small node.js server written in coffeescript (and compiled js, if needed) for the same service.

At present the only "functionality" is the display of other players locations on the page. That's pretty lame, right? But I'm tired...

To use:
1. runserver: 	coffee asteroid-server.coffee
		(or)	node asteroid-server.js
		
2. set the multiplayerURL in asteroids.js

3. host asteroids.js somewhere

4. point bookmarklet at your asteroids.js

5. fun!

FORK ME! Features you could add:

- some sort of client side animation-- interpolate (or extrapolate?) other players movements
- give players the ability to set a nickname which is shown next to their ship
- sync the destruction of the dom (in some fairly laissez-faire way, obviously)
- make the dom gradually regrow (to keep up with everyone destroying it)
server side...
- I'm parsing the params in a single regex. No comment.
- make the server better. seriously, it sucks
- is there a better way to identify players?
- is there a better way to store data than in memory?
- is there a better way to write players' locations?
- is there a better method for expiration?
-
the answer to all of these questions is yes. Let's do this!

My bookmarklet, for reference:

javascript:var%20s%20=%20document.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';document.body.appendChild(s);s.src='http://localhost/~adrian/asteroids.js';void(0);
