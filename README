This is a very, very basic multiplayer functionality hacked on top of erike's asteroids bookmarklet at http://erkie.github.com/ .

Also included is a very, very small node.js server written in coffeescript (and compiled js, if needed) for the same service.

At present the only "functionality" is the display of other players locations on the page. That's pretty lame, right? But I'm tired...

To use:
1. runserver: 	coffee asteroid-server.coffee
		(or)	node asteroid-server.js
		
2. set the multiplayerURL in asteroids.js

3. host asteroids.js somewhere

4. point bookmarklet at your asteroids.js

5. fun!

FORK ME! There's lots of ideas I had in TODO-- you must have ideas too. Go nuts!

My bookmarklet, for reference:

javascript:var%20s%20=%20document.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';document.body.appendChild(s);s.src='http://localhost/~adrian/asteroids.js';void(0);

(credit to erike, again)
