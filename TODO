Features you could add:

- some sort of client side animation-- interpolate (or extrapolate?) other players movements
- give players the ability to set a nickname which is shown next to their ship
- sync the destruction of the dom (in some fairly laissez-faire way, obviously)
- make the dom gradually regrow (to keep up with everyone destroying it)
server side...
- I'm parsing the params in a single regex. No comment.
- make the server better. seriously, it sucks
- is there a better way to identify players?
- is there a better way to store data than in memory?
- is there a better way to write players' locations?
- is there a better method for expiration?

the answer to all of these questions is yes. Let's do this!
